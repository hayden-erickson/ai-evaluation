# Task
Modify this API so that each habit also has a duration stored in seconds.
The habit logs should also have a duration.
If the habit has a duration, the corresponding log must as well. 
If the habit has no duration, the log does not need one. 

# Requirements
Make this change with the smallest possible number of modifications to the existing code.
It is fine to add as many new files and code as needed.
