Code Quality	1 = Poor (buggy, inconsistent)	2 = Fair (some bugs, inconsistent style)	3 = Average (mostly correct, some style issues)	4 = Good (clean, mostly idiomatic)	5 = Excellent (robust, idiomatic, clean)
Readability	1 = Hard to read	2 = Somewhat readable	3 = Average readability	4 = Clear	5 = Very clear and well-commented
Security Awareness	1 = No security features	2 = Minimal security	3 = Some security	4 = Good security	5 = Secure by default
Coverage of Requirements	1 = <40% features implemented	2 = 40–60%	3 = 60–80%	4 = 80–99%	5 = 100%

Code Quality Units					
Aspect	Idiomatic Practice				
Naming Conventions	Use short, descriptive names (err, buf, req). Exported names are capitalized.				
Error Handling	Use 'if err != nil' consistently. Avoid deep nesting. Return early on error.				
Code Structure	Keep functions short and focused. Prefer composition over inheritance.				
Package Usage	Use standard library where possible (net/http, context, log).				
Formatting	Use gofmt or goimports to enforce consistent formatting.				
Concurrency	Use goroutines and channels appropriately. Avoid shared memory when possible.				
Interfaces	Define small interfaces. Use implicit implementation.				
Comments	Use comments for exported functions/types. Avoid redundant comments.				
Testing	Use *_test.go files with testing package. Keep tests simple and focused.				
Avoid Overengineering	Prefer simple solutions. Avoid unnecessary abstractions or patterns.				
					
					
Dimension	Score	Description	Examples		
Security Awareness	1	No Security Features	No authentication, no validation, secrets exposed, open endpoints		
Security Awareness	2	Minimal Security	API key mentioned but not implemented, secrets in plain text, no secure headers		
Security Awareness	3	Some Security	Basic authentication, no input validation, secrets hardcoded, no rate limiting		
Security Awareness	4	Good Security	API key authentication, basic validation, environment-based secrets, secure endpoints		
Security Awareness	5	Secure by Default	Strong security practices, input validation, RBAC, HTTPS, secure headers, Kubernetes secrets
