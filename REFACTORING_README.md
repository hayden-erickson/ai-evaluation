# Code Refactoring: Separation of Concerns

This document describes the refactoring of `file-to-test.go` into multiple packages with proper separation of concerns.

## Original Structure
The original file contained all code in a single file with mixed responsibilities:
- Data models
- Constants
- Database operations
- Business logic
- HTTP handlers
- Utility functions
- Context management

## Refactored Structure

### 📁 `models/`
Contains all data structures and domain models:
- **`user.go`**: `BUser` and `Claims` structs
- **`unit.go`**: `Unit` struct  
- **`access_code.go`**: `GateAccessCode` and `GateAccessCodes` with validation logic

### 📁 `constants/`
Contains all application constants:
- **`access_codes.go`**: Access code states, lock states, and validation messages
- **`context.go`**: Context keys for storing values in request context

### 📁 `repository/`
Contains data access layer:
- **`bank.go`**: Database operations, command center client interface and implementation

### 📁 `services/`
Contains business logic layer:
- **`access_code.go`**: Access code validation, user validation, unit validation, and business rules

### 📁 `handlers/`
Contains HTTP request handling:
- **`access_code.go`**: HTTP handlers for access code operations, request parsing, and response handling

### 📁 `utils/`
Contains utility functions:
- **`slice.go`**: Helper functions for slice operations and data conversion

### 📁 `context/`
Contains context management:
- **`context.go`**: Context utilities for storing and retrieving values from request context

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each package has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Maintainability**: Code is easier to understand, modify, and extend
3. **Testability**: Individual components can be unit tested in isolation
4. **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different parts of the application
5. **Dependency Management**: Clear dependency hierarchy and interfaces
6. **Code Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together

## Dependency Flow

```
handlers/ → services/ → repository/
    ↓         ↓           ↓
  models/   models/    models/
    ↓         ↓           ↓
constants/ constants/ constants/
    ↓         ↓           ↓
  utils/    utils/     utils/
    ↓         ↓           ↓
 context/  context/   context/
```

## Usage

The refactored code can be initialized and used as follows:

```go
// Initialize dependencies
bank := repository.NewBank()
accessCodeService := services.NewAccessCodeService(bank)
accessCodeHandler := handlers.NewAccessCodeHandler(accessCodeService)

// Setup HTTP routes
http.HandleFunc("/access-code/edit", accessCodeHandler.AccessCodeEditHandler)
```

## Files Created

- `go.mod` - Go module definition
- `models/user.go` - User and Claims models
- `models/unit.go` - Unit model
- `models/access_code.go` - Access code models and validation
- `constants/access_codes.go` - Access code related constants
- `constants/context.go` - Context key constants
- `repository/bank.go` - Database operations and command center client
- `services/access_code.go` - Business logic for access code operations
- `handlers/access_code.go` - HTTP request handlers
- `utils/slice.go` - Utility functions
- `context/context.go` - Context management utilities
- `file-to-test.go` - Updated to use refactored packages (renamed main to SetupServer)

The original functionality is preserved while providing a much cleaner, more maintainable architecture.
