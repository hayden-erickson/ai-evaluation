# AI Evaluation - Refactored Code Structure

This project has been refactored from a single monolithic file into a well-organized, modular structure following Go best practices and separation of concerns.

## Project Structure

```

├── go.mod                          # Go module definition
├── original-file.go                # Original monolithic file (for reference)

    ├── clients/                    # External service clients and interfaces

```

## Package Responsibilities

### `models/`
Contains all domain models and business entities:
- **user.go**: `BUser` and `Claims` structs representing users and authentication
- **unit.go**: `Unit` struct representing rental units
- **access_code.go**: `GateAccessCode` and validation logic

### `constants/`
Contains all application constants:
- **access_codes.go**: Access code states, lock states, and validation messages

### `clients/`
Contains external service clients and their interfaces:
- **bank.go**: `BankInterface` and `CommandCenterInterface` definitions with concrete implementations

### `handlers/`
Contains HTTP request handlers:
- **access_code.go**: `AccessCodeEditHandler` for processing access code edit requests

### `utils/`
Contains utility functions:
- **slice.go**: Helper functions for slice operations like `UniqueIntSlice` and `ConvertToStringSlice`

### `context/`
Contains context management utilities:
- **context.go**: Functions for managing context values like claims and bank instances

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each package has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Testability**: Individual components can be easily unit tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to one component don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Packages can be imported and used by other parts of the application
5. **Interface-based Design**: Clients are defined as interfaces, making them easy to mock and test
6. **Go Best Practices**: Follows standard Go project layout with internal packages

## Usage

To run the application:

```bash
go run main.go
```

The server will start on port 8080 and provide the access code edit endpoint at `/api/access-code/edit`.

## Testing

Each package can be tested independently:

```bash
go test ./internal/models/...
go test ./internal/handlers/...
go test ./internal/utils/...
# etc.
```
